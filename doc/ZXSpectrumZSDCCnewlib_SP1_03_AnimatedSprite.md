# ZX Spectrum Development with C, Z88DK and SP1 - Animated Sprite

This document describes how a ZX Spectrum developer can use the SP1 sprite
library to animate a sprite on screen. It follows on from the [second
document](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_SP1_02_SimpleMaskedSprite.md)
in the series, which the reader is assumed to have read.

This document is part of the [ZX Spectrum Z88DK/C developer's getting
started guide](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_GettingStartedGuide.md).

## Purpose


### The Sprite Data

For this article we're going stay with the same sort of 8x8 pixel, single column
sprites we've used so far in the series. The animated sprite we're going to use
is a little "runner" character kindly supplied by
[Sol_HSA](https://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/profile/10193/Sol_HSA) over at
World of Spectrum. Here it is as an animated GIF file:

Save this listing to a file called *runner_sprite.asm*.

## Animating the sprite

Here's the code to draw the sprite. Save it to a file called 'runner.c':

```
```

The compile line is:

```
```


## Conclusion


### Where To Go From Here
