# ZX Spectrum Development with C, Z88DK and SP1 - Bigger, Colourful Sprites

This document, the 4th in the SP1 part of the [ZX Spectrum Z88DK/C developer's
getting started
guide](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_GettingStartedGuide.md),
builds on the previous 3 installments, showing how to create bigger and more
colourful sprites. It follows on from the [third
document](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_SP1_03_AnimatedSprite.md)
which looked at anmiation.

## Purpose

So far in this SP1 series we've only looked at small, single character cell,
monochrome sprites. While simple to explore and understand, 8x8 pixel sprites
are of limited use for games. We need to look at how SP1 handles bigger sprites,
and sprites with colour.
