Windows and MacOSX users can get zsdcc and zsdcpp binaries from the [nightly build](http://nightly.z88dk.org/).

To build from source apply the patch in this directory to sdcc #9958.
Compile instructions can be found [here](https://www.z88dk.org/wiki/doku.php?id=temp:front#sdcc1).

For an error-free compile you may want to limit the target cpus in the build to just the z80 family (z80/z180/rabbits)
